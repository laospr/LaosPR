Ever questioned? Why Lao Labour wage rates are so low, I did question around for many of years to the investors and local entrepreneurs. And, only one replied with the questions if Lao Labour with local educations is well practiced and experienced the needs.

The questions are answered once discovered with returned Lao Labour, the local education is not the issue as we have learned and studied the same thing as global did; only the educators themselves do not experience and can not deliver such the good practice as needed for the real work of working.

Today, I discovered a new series of the question as per local worker with online working experience plus experience with the international working environment; which is still considered local skilled labor.
